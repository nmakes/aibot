				Explanation of the algorithm followed for joint probability:

				We go one by one on each variable in the given list of variables.
				If the parent of the given variable already exists, we ignore it.
				Otherwise, we calculate two joint probabilities corresponding to each parent,
				and sum it. This function is called recursively until all the variables' parents
				are exhausted.

				For eg.

					If the bayesian network is as follows:
					
					par    children
					A  --> B, C
					B  --> D, C
					E  --> B
				
				Consider the expression

					P(C,D)

				The following will be the execution:
				
				Expand C's parents.
				
					= P(C,D,A,B) + P(C,D,A,~B) + P(C,D,~A,B) + P(C,D,~A,~B)
				
				Now, all C's parents have been expanded. P will be called on
				each of the four expressions.

					(a) Consider P(C,D,A,B).

						C's parents already exist in the joint probability list (agenda).
						So skip to the next variable, ie. D. D's parents also exist.
						So, skip to A. A doesn't have parents, so skip to B.

							= P(C,D,A,B,E) + P(C,D,A,B,~E)

						Now, apply the same again on each of these two.

							(i) Consider P(C,D,A,B,E).

								All parents exist in the expression, so we are ready to evaluate it.

								To evaluate it, do the following:

									= P(C|parents) * P(D|parents) * P(A|parents) * P(B|parents) * P(E|parents)
								
								We know C's parents A and B occur in the form 'A' and 'B'. 
								Similarly, for B. 
								A doesn't have parents, so this reduces to P(A).
								B has a parent E, which occurs in the form 'E'.
								E doesn't have parents, so this is just P(E)

								Thus the above reduces to:

									= P(C|A,B) * P(D|B) * P(A) * P(B|A,E) * P(E)
								
								This can be obtained from the corresponding CPTs for each variable.

							(ii) Consider P(C,D,A,B,~E).
							
								Following the discussion in part (i) this above reduces to:

									= P(C|A,B) * P(D|B) * P(A) * P(B|~E) * P(~E)
								
								which can be obtained from the corresponding CPTs.

						From (i) and (ii) we find P(C,D,A,B) by adding them.

					(b) P(C,D,A,~B).
					(c) P(C,D,~A,B).
					(d) P(C,D,~A,~B).

				(b), (c), (d) can be found in similar way as explained in (a).

				Adding these four, we get the result of P(C,D).
